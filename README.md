# GymFinder

**GymFinder** is a personal project that I decided to create in order to use all (or most) of my skills. This project consists of a platform where gyms and potential clients can connect with each other.

### ðŸš€ Main Modules

1. **Users**  
    Includes registration, login, logout, user administration, password recovery, profile editing and role management (user, admin, gym owner, instructor, etc.).
2. **Gyms**  
    A user can request the *gym* role, allowing them to manage a registered business on the platform. 
    This module inlcudes photo uploads, descriptions, location, available equipment, training options, ratings, etc.
3. **Posts**  
    This module includes the logic for users or gyms to create posts with photos, videos, or simply text.
4. **Search**  
    The search module offers different filter options such as location, type of training, rating and more.
